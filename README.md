# Limit tabs

This add-on limits tabs by removing a tab when a new tab is added that takes the number of open tabs to more than the limit. Pinned tabs are ignored. The limit can be applied per window (default) or globally.

Based on https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rudolf-fernandes/ with changes to support Chrome.
